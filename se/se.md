# System  
a collection of grnarilized and organization of elements and components for a common purpose order to facilitate the flow of information.  

## System Interacting Components or Function  
- input: 
capturing and assembling elements that enter the system to be processed. For Eg - raw materials, energy, data, and human effort must be secured and organized for processing.  
- process:  
transformation processes that convert input into output. Eg. Manufacturing process, Mathematical calculation.
- output:  
transferring elements that have been produced by a transformation process to their ultimate destination. Eg. Manufactured product.

# data 
Data are raw facts and figures that are set of isolated, unrelated, and uninterpreted.  
can be collected from various sources obtained through interview, questionnaire, on-site observation, counting, measuring, weighing, sampling etc.  

# information
processed data or a set of organized, validated, corrected and collected data that forms a meaningful information to the user so that decision maker may take necessary actions.  

# information system
interrelated components working together to collect data, process it, gives output and store using the resources of hardware, software, people, procedure and controlling mechanism.
## or
A set of interrelated components working together to collect, retrieve, process, store, and
distribute information for the purpose of facilitating planning, control, coordination,
analysis, and decision making in business organizations.  

### uses by:
- Corporations use information systems to reach their potential customers with targeted messages over the Web, to process financial accounts, and to manage their human resources.
- Governments deploy information systems to provide services cost-effectively to citizens. Digital goods, such as electronic books and software, and online services, such as auctions and social networking, are delivered with information systems.
- Individuals rely on information systems, generally Internet-based, for conducting much of their personal lives: for socializing, study, shopping, banking, and entertainment.

# information system components:
* Hardware: Physical device  
* Software: Tells hardware what to do  
* Data: Info manipulated by software  
* People: All people involved  
* Process: Steps to accomplish a goal 

# types of information systems

- Transaction Processing Systems : strategic decisions
- Management Information Systems : tactical decisions

- Executive Information Systems: operational decisions


# Software Development Life Cycle  
Software development life cycle is a systematic process of developing any software.
  helps to:
- Develop the software
- Track the progress of software development
- Manage the changes appeared in the system
- Minimize the risk of system failure
